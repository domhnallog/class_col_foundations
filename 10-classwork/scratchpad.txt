### GETTING / MAKING A KEY: 

in cmd, as root:
ssh-keygen -f C:/foundations_key -t rsa -b 4096

C:\Users\Domhnall\Keys

### SETTING UP SERVER

- connect to server, 
ssh -i C:/Users/Domhnall/Keys/foundations_key root@138.197.73.93

- change prompt color 
echo "export PS1=\"\[\033[40m\]\[\033[47m\]server\[\033[0m\] \[\033[31m\]\[\e]0;\u@\h: \w\a\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h\[\033[0m\]:\w\$ \"" > ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile

- download updates for everything on the server:
apt update

- upgrade all software and provide yes to every 
apt -y upgrade

- install python 3 and pip: 
- (py2 is the default on digitalocean):
apt install -y python3 python3-pip 

- install various python libraries:
- (must say pip3, again because py2 is installed default and pip):
pip3 install ipython3 bs4 requests selenium pandas numpy datetime matplotlib python-dotenv

- install mail utilities if req:
- ("local only" server may work best)
apt install -y mailutils

- install ipython, the commandline version/precursor of jupyter:
apt install ipython3

- run ipython:
ipython3

- exit ipython
exit()

### RUN SOME TEST CODING

- run some jupyter code right in the command line of the server / watch magic:
- (don't copy / use the three quotes):
'''
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

response = requests.get('https://www.bbc.com/')
doc = BeautifulSoup(response.text)

titles = doc.find_all(class_='media__link')
for title in titles:
  print(title.text.strip())
'''

### COPYING FILES TO & FROM THE SERVER

- copy a file from local to server (scp = secure copy):
- (while in the directory where the files to copy exist, otherwise need more explicit code):
scp -i C:/Users/Domhnall/Keys/foundations_key scraper.py root@138.197.73.93:~

- copy files from server to local:
- (the code "~/*.csv" = from my home directory on the server, copy every csv-type):
- (the code "~/nyt*.txt" = from my home directory on the server, copy every txt-type that starts with nyt):
- (the final period "." = copy to here, the exact directory this local prompt is in):
scp -i C:/Users/Domhnall/Keys/foundations_key root@138.197.73.93:~/*.csv .
scp -i C:/Users/Domhnall/Keys/foundations_key root@138.197.73.93:~/nyt*.txt .

### DISCONNECT FROM SERVER
exit
logout
