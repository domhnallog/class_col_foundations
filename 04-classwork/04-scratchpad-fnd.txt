Planet question:
	[droid_url['name'] for droid_url in spec_droid['people']
	while loop = ?


List Comprehension:
Starting with this . . .
	response = requests.get("https://swapi.co/api/people/?search=3po")
	search_3po = response.json()
	droid_url = search_3po['results'][0]['species'][0]

This . . .
	response = requests.get(f'{droid_url}')
	spec_droid = response.json()
	for droid_url in spec_droid['people']:
		response = requests.get(droid_url)
		droid_page = response.json()
		for droids in droid_page:
        		print(droids['name'])
	
Becomes this . . . 
	droids = [requests.get(droid_url).json() for droid_url in spec_droid['people']]
	for droid in droids:
    		print(droid['name'])
